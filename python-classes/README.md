This repository contains a Python project focused on classes and objects. It's designed to help you understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.


## Introduction

Object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept in Python and many other programming languages. This project provides a practical guide to working with classes and objects in Python. You'll learn how to create classes, define attributes and methods, and how to use them effectively in your Python programs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juansechaux/python-classes-and-objects.git
