## Introduction

This project serves as a demonstration of Test-driven Development (TDD) principles in Python. It includes a simple example with tests and the corresponding code. TDD is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the actual code. It helps ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
