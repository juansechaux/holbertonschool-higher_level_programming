# Python - Almost a circle

In this project, I will review everything about Python:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

And learn about:

- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Resources

- [args/kwargs](https://yasoob.me/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/)
- [JSON encoder and decoder](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
- [Python test cheatsheet](https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-tests.html)

## Why Does It Matter?

Understanding that everything in Python is an object has several important implications for developers. It leads to a consistent and elegant language design, which makes Python a powerful and versatile programming language. It also impacts how you work with and manipulate data in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
